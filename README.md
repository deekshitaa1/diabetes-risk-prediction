# Diabetes Risk Prediction 🧠🔬

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the risk of diabetes in patients based on health-related data.

## 🔍 Objective
To build a classification model that predicts whether a person is diabetic (1) or not (0).

## 📊 Dataset
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- Target: Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Not Diabetic)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results
Achieved good accuracy and insights on feature importance for predicting diabetes.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `DIABETES RISK PREDICTION.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells.
